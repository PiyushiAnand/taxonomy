# Indian Penal Code: Sections on Assault and Criminal Force

## Section 131: Punishment for Assault or Criminal Force Otherwise Than on Grave Provocation

and sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either  
description for a term which may extend to **three months**, or with fine which may extend to

- (c) If the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.  

### Explanation 2:
Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence is a **question of fact**.
