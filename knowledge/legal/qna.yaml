      answers related to kidnapping laws and cases.
    questions_and_answers:
       - question: "My sister’s 8-year-old daughter was playing outside our house when a man we barely know took her away on his bike. He told the other kids he was taking her to buy chocolates. Luckily, we found her at his house before anything worse happened. When we asked him, he said he ‘just wanted to spend time with her’ and thought it was okay. But we never gave him permission! Isn’t this kidnapping? What can we do?"
         answer: "Yes, this falls under kidnapping from lawful guardianship as per Section 137(1)(b) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Taking a child out of the lawful guardian’s custody without consent is considered kidnapping. The offender can be punished with imprisonment for up to seven years and a fine."

       - question: "My friend is going through a divorce, and her husband took their 5-year-old son away without telling her. She came home from work and found her child missing! After panicking and searching everywhere, she found out that her husband took the child to another city. He says he has the right because he’s the father, but she has custody for now. What legal action can she take?"
         answer: "Since your friend has custody, the act of taking the child without her consent qualifies as kidnapping from lawful guardianship under Section 137(1)(b). The father cannot take the child away unlawfully, and legal action can be pursued under this provision."

       - question: "Yesterday, a man tried to lure my 6-year-old brother away from our apartment gate. He told my brother that our mom had sent him to pick him up. Thankfully, our neighbor saw and stopped him, and the man ran away. We reported it to the police, but we are still shaken. What if he tries again? What more can we do?"
         answer: "Attempting to entice a child away from lawful guardianship without consent is an offense under Section 137(1)(b). Since an attempt was made, the authorities should investigate and take preventive action. You can seek legal protection and stronger police intervention."

       - question: "My cousin was promised a good job in Dubai by an agent, and he left without telling anyone. Now, we found out that his passport was taken away, and he is being forced to do work he never agreed to. He isn’t allowed to leave, and they barely let him talk to us. We are scared for his safety. Is this kidnapping? How can we bring him back?"
         answer: "Yes, this constitutes kidnapping from India under Section 137(1)(a), as your cousin was taken beyond the limits of India without proper informed consent. This situation may also involve human trafficking, requiring immediate intervention by legal authorities."

       - question: "There’s an elderly woman in our neighborhood who has some mental health issues. Her caretaker, who has been looking after her for years, suddenly found her missing. Later, we heard that her distant relatives took her away, claiming they would ‘take better care of her,’ but we know they just want her property. She didn’t understand what was happening and couldn’t consent to leaving. Can the caretaker do anything legally?"
         answer: "Yes, taking a person of unsound mind out of the custody of their lawful guardian without consent qualifies as kidnapping under Section 137(1)(b). Legal action can be taken against the relatives to restore her custody to the rightful caretaker."
